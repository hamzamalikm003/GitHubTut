    <div class="px-5">
        <h2 class="def">Definition:</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.Git is used to store
            the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows
            developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting
            changes from multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its
            public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. Each
            public or private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history.
            Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. </p>

                <p>Create a new file and add something in it then show the status of the file by using "git status" it
                    will show that your file is untracked, not commit the changes changes</p>
                <img src="assets/images/s1.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the "git add FileName" Command or "git add ." enter the file/files that you created into the
                    stagging area.and after that also check the status.

            <li>
                <p>After adding we use git commit command with some message to commit the changes in the git hub
                    Syntax "git commit –m “Message”"

                <p>Now we committed the changes. But these changes are not visible
                    online. The reason is that we have to push the repo. So enter "git push"
                    command. Now you can see changes on Github repo also.

                    match that content.
