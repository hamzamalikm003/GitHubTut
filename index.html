        <h2 class="def">Definition:</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.Git is used to store
            the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows
            developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting
            changes from multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its
            public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. Each
            public or private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history.
            Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. </p>
